Flipkart UI Clone
A front-end project focused on replicating the user interface of India's leading e-commerce platform, Flipkart.

🎯Project Goal
The objective of this project was to practice structural HTML and advanced CSS techniques. By avoiding JavaScript, I focused entirely on:

Layout Precision: Aligning complex navigation bars and multi-column grids.

Pure CSS Interactivity: Using :hover states for menus and buttons.

Component Styling: Creating reusable CSS classes for product cards and banners.

🛠 Technologies Used
HTML5: For semantic markup.

CSS3: For all styling, including Flexbox for the navigation and CSS Grid for the product sections.
